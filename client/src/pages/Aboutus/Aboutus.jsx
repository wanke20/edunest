          <h1>Inspiring Classrooms, One Supply at a Time.</h1>
          <p>At Edunest, we believe that every lesson holds the potential to inspire, enlighten, and transform young minds. But behind every impactful lesson lies the quiet support of essential teaching tools and resources.</p>
          <h1>Empowering Teachers Through Convenience</h1>
          <p>
            It all began with a simple observation: teachers, the architects of our future, spend a significant amount of time, effort, and out-of-pocket money in search of the right teaching materials. From markers to modular desks, sourcing the perfect supplies often becomes an added task on an already overflowing to-do list.<br /><br />

            We wondered, "What if we could make this process simpler? What if teachers could spend less time shopping and more time teaching?‚Äù<br /><br />

            And thus, Edunest was born.
